## Develop your idea

In this step, you will develop your idea and create your hypothesis. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**hypothesis**</span> is an assumption based on limited evidence. Your hypothesis will be the predicted answer you expect for your research idea. A clearly written hypothesis will help you help focus your experiment and write your report.

### Develop a research question

--- task ---

Start by thinking about a research question. You could create a list of possible questions then choose one to focus your experiment on. 

**Tip:** Choose topics that interests you. You don't need to be an expert in the topic but having an interest will help you create an enaging experiment. 

To start:

+ Think about what you would like to know about Life in Space or Life on Earth. Then ask  yourself "Is it possible to answer that question with the Astro Pi, it’s sensors and camera?"

Or

+ Research what interesting things you could investigate using the Astro Pi, it’s sensors and camera

Or

+ Investigate what machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques you could apply to data available from the Astro Pi, it’s sensors and camera

**Tip:** ⏱️ Try to set reasonable expectations of what is possible in the time you have available.
You might have an amazing idea, but do you have the time to get it working?

A quote from a 2021/22 winner. One of our biggest failures is the lack of coordination of time which meant that we had very little time to analyse the data and work on the project. We should therefore better coordinate time with the help of platforms like Trello for future projects.

### Write your research question 

--- task ---

To use your question as a basis for your hypothesis it must be focussed, precise and answerable. 

You could ask:

+ What is the relationship between x and y? 
+ How has x changed over time? 
+ What are the characteristics of x?
+ What are the main factors in x? 
+ What is the impact of X on Y?

### Create your hypothesis

--- task ---

Write your hypothesis. Your hypothesis should include:
+ What you will study
+ The variables
+ Your prediction

**Tip:** Get inspiration from some of last years winners:

Life in Space:
+ 🌿 Plant species bring comfort and wellness to the astronauts. Identifying the most suitable plant species will greatly improve the indoor environment of the ISS.
+ 🌗 When astronauts stay on the ISS for extended periods of time their health is impacted by disturbances in their circadian rhythm due to varying light levels. 
+ 🧲 As the ISS is located quite low above Earth there is only a slight difference in the strength of the magnetic field between day and night side of the Earth at the height of the ISS. 

Life on Earth:
+ 🌧️ Classifying clouds in real-time can alert local dangers such as flash flooding and strong turbulence. 
+ 🏔️ The fractal dimension of snow layers on mountain ranges enables the determination of geological formation age.
+ 🌱 Areas on Earth with the highest humidity and heat (tropical or temperate climates) are ideal for vegetation growth so produce the healthiest plants.

### Choose a secondary goal

--- task ---

Does your experiment require a specific event (for example the ISS to pass over mountain). What will you do if this doesn’t happen? 

Create a related secondary goal in the unlikely event your primary experiment is unsuccessful.

Here are some common constraints that impact success:
+ 🌍 The ISS orbital path restrictions mean there are some places the ISS does not travel over
+ 💧 The Earth's surface is 70% water
+ ☁️ Cloud cover might obscure your target
+ During your experiment the ISS will not pass over the same place twice
+ 🔎 You will not see anything small than 10 football fields in the photographs
+ 💡 The LED matrix cannot be used for Life on Earth. 
+ 📷 The camera can only be used as a sensor for Life in Space to protect the privacy of the astronauts
+ 📅 You can't choose the date, time of day or position of the ISS when your experiment runs
+ 🌡️ The cameras do not have thermal imaging capacity to measure the Earth's temperature
