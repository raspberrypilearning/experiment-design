## Test and present your measurements

In this step, you will review methods for presenting your data and simulating your experiment on Earth. 

### Present your measurements

--- task ---

There are many ways to present your measurements. You could: 
+ Produce an altitude map
+ Create a scatter plotter
+ Chart data on a map
+ Review side by side images 
+ Overlay images
+ Make colourmaps
... and many more. Which technique will you use?

### Comparative testing

--- task ---

Whilst you cant at this stage run your experiment in space, you should be able to find ways to test your hypothesis to a dgree by simulating the environment or using other datasets. 

**Tip:** Make notes about any comparative testing you performed for inclusion in your final report.

A quote from a 2021/22 winner. We decided to use Astro Pi pressure, humidity and temperature sensors to monitor the main ISS environmental parameters. We built greenhouses and a darkroom on Earth to simulate the conditions.
