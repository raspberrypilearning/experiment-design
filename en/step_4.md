## Test and present your measurements

In this step, you will review methods for presenting your data and simulating your experiment on Earth. 

### Comparative testing

--- task ---

Whilst you can't at this stage run your experiment in space, you should be able to find ways to test your hypothesis by simulating the environment or using other datasets for comparison. 

**Tip:** Make notes about any comparative testing you performed for inclusion in your final report.

A quote from a 2021/22 winner: "We decided to use Astro Pi pressure, humidity and temperature sensors to monitor the main ISS environmental parameters. We built greenhouses and a darkroom on Earth to simulate the conditions."

### Present your measurements

When answering your research question, it is important to present your findings in a clear and concise way. Creating charts and graphics to demonstrate your measurements will make your report more appealing and easy to understand for the judges.

There are many ways to present your measurements. You could: 
+ Produce an altitude map
+ Create a scatter plotter
+ Chart data on a map
+ Review side by side images 
+ Overlay images
+ Make colourmaps
... and many more. 

Which technique will you use?
