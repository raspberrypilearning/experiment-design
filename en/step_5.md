## Submit your idea

Mentors can use the Astro Pi dashboard to enter the team details and submit the experiment idea. You should be able to answer these two questions:

+ What is your experiment idea?
+ How will you use the Astro Pi computers to perform your experiment?

Once the mentor has [signed up](https://missions.astro-pi.org/), they will be contacted by the Astro Pi team to register their team's details and their experiment idea.

Your answers to these questions will help us assess your experiment for its feasibility, scientific value, and creativity.
