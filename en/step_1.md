### PROJECT BRIEF: Create an experiment entry for Mission Space Lab
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Create an experiment to run on the Astro Pi computers on board the ISS. 

To enter Mission Space Lab, you must organise a team. 

Your team should have:
+ A mentor to [sign up](https://missions.astro-pi.org/login){:target="_blank"} and be the main contact point
+ Between 2 and 6 young people and all team members must be aged 19 or younger
+ At least half the team registered as citizens of an [eligible country](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/eligibility){:target="_blank"} 


Mission Space Lab has two themes, you must choose one. 

The theme of your entry could be:
+ Life on Earth &mdash; use the Astro Pi camera to collect evidence of an Earth-based hypothesis
+ Life in space &mdash; use the Astro Pi sensors to collect evidence of a space-based hypothesis


Your entry must be submitted before the deadline.

**A quote from a 2021/22 winner:** "The idea of this experiment came to us when we checked the previous projects and we came across the Juno teamâ€™s experiment from Spain."

Astro Pi Mission Space Lab entries can be completely original or can take an alternative look at a previous entry.

You could look at a previous discovery in more detail or find a way to overcome a challenge the experiment met.
