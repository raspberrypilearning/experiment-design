## What next?

If accepted for Phase 2, your team will write the program for the experiment you have proposed, and then test and submit it. These are the steps involved:

1. **Acceptance to Phase 2** <br>
You will receive an email confirming your acceptance to Phase 2 of the challenge. You will also receive a team ID for your team.

2. **Receive your kit** <br>
We will send an Astro Pi kit for your school or club to the address you provided in your Phase 1 submission. Each mentor will receive one kit only. This kit will contain the same hardware that is included in the Astro Pi computers on the ISS, and additional components that will differ depending on the type of experiment that your team wants to conduct.

3. **Create your experiment** <br>
Check out our comprehensive [Mission Space Lab Phase 2 project guide](https://rpf.io/ap-msl-guide) for help with assembling your kit, and writing and testing your experiment program. This guide also includes essential information on what is and isnâ€™t possible with the Astro Pi hardware and software.

For more detailed information on the Astro Pi hardware and how best to use it, take a look at our [Mission Space Lab resources](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/resources).
