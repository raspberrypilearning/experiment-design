## Define your measurements

In this step, you will decide what you will measure and how you will collect those measurements. 

### Astro Pi sensors and photograps, and other datasets

--- task ---

From which Astro Pi instruments do you need to take measurements, in order to test your hypothesis?

The Astro Pi sensors:
+ PIR (passive infrared sensor)
+ Colour and luminosity sensor
+ Temperature sensor
+ Pressure sensor

Imagagin from the:
+ Near-infrared camera
+ Visible-light camera 

Positional data from the IMU:
+ Gyroscope 
+ Aaccelerometer
+ Magnetometer

Machine learning models:
+ Coral ML accelerator

Do you need any external data to classify or compare your results?

Last year teams used: 

+ NASA and ESA photo databases to help train a model 
+ Previous Astro Pi images
+ [KÃ¶ppen climate classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification){:target="_blank"} to map climates on Earth 
+ Results obtained by another team competing in Astro Pi Mission Space Lab to help explain  chromatic data results
+ NASA World View with a layer applied [(Enhanced Vegetation Index, L3 Monthly)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13a3v061/){:target="_blank"} for pre-Pandemic comparison  
.... and many more!

What resources can you find online that might help test **your** hypothesis?

### Collecting your measurements

--- task ---

**Choose:** There are 3 ways to collect data. Which method will you use? 
+ Collect data for analysis back on earth (for example take a measurement every 5 seconds for 3 hours)
+ Collect data with some intelligence (for example only take photos when the ISS is in daylight)
+ Process data in real time against pre-programmed rules (for example test a machine learning classifier to see whether it can identify cloud types in real time.)

An important thing to remember when designing a Mission Space Lab experiment is the **3Gb** storage available to each team. If you are taking high quality images at short intervals, you will find that you reach data capacity quite quickly. You may also find that, due to the nature of the flight of the ISS, many of the images you take will be of water or clouds.

**Think:** Consider any restrictions you want to put in place to improve the quality of your measurements in line with your experiment: 

Our 2021/22 winners opted for a range of different restrictions. For example, image restrictions included:
+ Restricting image size - to receive photos that were a decent quality but allowed more captured photos within the 3GB limit. 
+ Restricting the time when images are taken - 10 seconds intervals enabled capturing of a wide variety of photos  within the 3GB limit. 
+ Creating a fast sampling mode - to maintain a steady sampling rate at times when a variance was detected 
+ Tracking the ISS position - to discard photos if the ISS position was on the dark side of the earth to free up more storage. 
+ Discard night and ocean photos.

**Tip:** If you are taking measurements from the temperature sensor you need to allow some compensation for the heat generated by the Raspberry Pi's CPU. How will you check that your compensation code works?

**Tip:** The climate onboard the ISS is regulated so temperature, pressure and humidity variations will be tiny.
